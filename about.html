<h2 id="colors">colors.</h2>
<p id="beginp">We do colors. That's our thing. Thousands of lip shades get tested over and over again in labs to get just the right shade. Consumers only 
ever see the shades that some company executives decided they would like. We don't want to try and guess what you want. We'll give you everything so that 
you can have the power of choosing for yourself. Having a rolling production of thousands of colors at a time isn't feasible for a tiny little company like us,
 so we present the options in bite-sized pieces that you can work off while you wait for the new stuff. We get so excited about new products that we keep 
 a countdown to the next collection release right here. Check back on December 25th after 8 am to grab the new stuff as soon as possible.

// Set the date we're counting down to
var countDownDate = new Date("Dec 25, 2018 08:00:00").getTime();

// Update the count down every 1 second
var x = setInterval(function() {

    // Get todays date and time
    var now = new Date().getTime();
    
    // Find the distance between now and the count down date
    var distance = countDownDate - now;
    
    // Time calculations for days, hours, minutes and seconds
    var days = Math.floor(distance / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24));
    var hours = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
    var minutes = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
    var seconds = Math.floor((distance % (1000 * 60)) / 1000);
    
    // Output the result in an element with id="demo"
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = days + "d " + hours + "h "
    + minutes + "m " + seconds + "s ";

    if (distance < 0) {

<div id="aboutcolumn2">
<h1 class="who">who we are.</h1>
<p id="beginp2">It all started with one heart, two pet bunnies, and a passion for beauty. Our founder, SLP, was a makeup enthusiast from a very young 
age. This love, combined with accumulated business skills, engendered the birth of this company. She had used makeup religiously, though not without the
 guilt of buying products that had been tested on animals. She wanted to make a high-quality, vegan, cruelty-free makeup brand that represented her and 
 everyone else who loves animals and makeup with the same amount of respect. Thus came the birth of SLP cosmetics and a world of options as to how to 
 make our products stand out. We decided to make them one-of-a-kind, just like our brand, by producing in limited quantities so as to always give our
 customers something unique. Standing out and being vegan never looked so good. We hope that our products look so good on you that they'll spark conversation 
 with your admirers about vegan makeup and how it makes an impact on both humans and animals.

<h1 class="veganh1">about that.</h1>
<p class="veganp">SLP cosmetics is committed to excellence in every way. When a product is made, from the time its idea is conceived to the day it's
 delivered to the customer's doorstep, we keep everything clean and ethical. Our ingredients are of the highest grade and quality, almost all locally 
 sourced. Not only that, but the cosmetics are all made in our own U.S. factories to ensure that they are made ethically and not contaminated with animal 
 products or by-products. Under our watchful eye, we can ensure that no secret animal testing goes on right under our noses. In addition to keeping animals in 
 mind, we guarantee the safety of our employees. Ethical working conditions are essential to running a brand correctly. Our employees are paid a living wage 
 according to the area in which they live and work, alongside that receiving health insurance and other benefits for themselves and their families. It may cost us 
 a bit more to run our company this way, but we don't feel bad about it.

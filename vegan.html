<h1 class="veganh1">certified vegan.</h1>
<p class="veganp"><strong><a href="https://vegan.org/">vegan.org</a></strong> gives its approval so that you can, too. we want our customers to have a
clear conscience, so we got a big check mark on all of our products. Vegan Action did a thorough run-through of our products' ingredients lists so that
all you have to look for is their stamp of approve. Vegan Action certifies that our cosmetics do not contain any animal products. That means you won't
find any eggs, meat, fish, fowl, honey, milk...you get the idea. this certification also means that our products & ingredients have not been tested on
animals by the supplier, manufacturer, or producer.

<h1 class="veganh1">we promise.</h1>
<p class="veganp">SLP cosmetics was started and continues to be run by an animal lover. the company's workers are hired knowing that vegan and cruelty-free
are not just goals, but necessary to run a brand like ours. as technology continues to improve, the availability of vegan ingredients is no longer an excuse.
scientists at SLP cosmetics know that if it isn't vegan, it's not our product. consumers can use our cosmetics knowing that no animals were harmed in the 
making and testing processes. this has been our pledge since the beginning of the company and always will be. guaranteed.</p>
